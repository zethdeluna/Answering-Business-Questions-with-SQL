# The Project
In this project, we'll be working with a modified version of the [Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), which contains information about a fictional digital music shop. The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases.

## Mock Business Analyses
#### Chinook's New Record Deal
The Chinook record store has just signed a deal with a new record label, and I've been tasked with selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, from a list of four. All four albums are by artists that don't have any tracks in the store right now â€“ we have the artist names, and the genre of music they produce.

#### Sales Support Agent Performance
Each customer for the Chinook store gets assigned to a sales support agent within the company when they first make a purchase. I have been asked to analyze the purchases of customers belonging to each employee to see if any sales support agent is performing either better or worse than the others.

#### Sales by Country
I have now been tasked to analyze the sales data for customers for each different country. In particular, I have been directed to calculate data for each country on the:
* total number of customers
* total value of sales
* average value of sales per customer
* average order value

#### Albums vs. Individual Tracks
The Chinook store is set up in a way that allows customers to make purchases in one of the two ways:
* purchase a whole album
* purchase a collection of one or more individual tracks

The store does not let customers purchase a whole album, and then add individual tracks to that same purchase (unless they do that by choosing each track manually). When customers purchase albums they are charged the same price as if they had purchased each of those tracks separately.

Management are currently considering changing their purchasing strategy to save money. The strategy they are considering is to purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies, instead of purchasing every track from an album.

I have been asked to find out what percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums, so that management can use this data to understand the effect this decision might have on overall revenue.
